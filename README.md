Oh, sure! Because who needs actual legitimate IPs when you can have a bunch of random, untrustworthy ones instead? Feel free to use these Black'n'White listed IPs for testing purposes only, but don't blame us if your entire network gets compromised. We thought it would be fun to mix in some legitimate IPs with the shady ones, just to keep you on your toes. So go ahead, use it at your own risk and enjoy the thrill of not knowing which IP will bring down your entire system. Happy testing!
